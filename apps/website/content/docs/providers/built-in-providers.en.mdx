## What is Built-in AI Provider Configuration

Read Frog has built-in support for multiple mainstream large language model providers, allowing you to choose the most suitable model for translation and reading comprehension.

Click the "Add Provider" button, select the "Built-in LLM Providers" section, and choose the provider you want to use.

### Step 3: Get API Key

Add the API Key in the corresponding field. Here's how to get API keys for major providers:

| Provider | API Key Location | Special Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) | Requires payment method |
| Google | [aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) | Has free quota |
| DeepSeek | [platform.deepseek.com/api_keys](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) | Very cost-effective |


### Step 4: Configure Model Selection

We have two scenarios: translation and reading. We recommend choosing the appropriate model based on your use case.

| Scenario | Description | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Translation | Only used to translate text from one language to another | Recommend using faster small models |
| Reading | Read articles and perform analysis and summarization | Requires models that support structured output |

<Callout type="warn">
**Read Frog's reading feature requires AI models to output JSON objects in a specific format. Not all models support this feature**

- ✅ **Full Support**: OpenAI GPT series, Google Gemini series, Anthropic Claude series
- ⚠️ **Partial Support**: DeepSeek, most open-source models (may need adjustment)
- ❌ **Not Supported**: Older models or models that don't support JSON output
</Callout>

### Step 5: Verify Configuration

After configuration, test it:

1. Click the "Test Connection" button
2. System sends test request
3. Check the returned result to confirm configuration is correct
4. If it fails, check API key and network connection

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Configuration Issues

| Issue Type | Symptoms | Solutions | Verification Method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API Key Error | "Invalid API Key" | Re-copy key, check for spaces | Test connection button |
| Insufficient Balance | "Quota exceeded" | Top up account or switch provider | Check provider console |
| Network Issues | Connection timeout | Check network, try proxy | Ping provider domain |
| Model Restrictions | Model unavailable | Check permissions, choose other model | Review provider documentation |

## Summary

With this guide, you should be able to:

1. ✅ Understand the features and applicable scenarios of each provider
2. ✅ Successfully configure the required AI providers
3. ✅ Choose appropriate models for translation and reading
4. ✅ Solve common configuration and usage issues

If you encounter other issues during use, we recommend checking the provider's official documentation or seeking help in the Read Frog [Discord](https://discord.gg/ej45e3PezJ) community.
