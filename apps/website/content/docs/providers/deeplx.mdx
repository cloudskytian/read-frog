## What is DeepLX?

DeepLX is a free, unofficial API that provides DeepL-like translation quality through reverse engineering. It offers an alternative to the official DeepL API for developers who need high-quality translation services without the cost.

## Flexible BaseURL Configuration

Read Frog supports flexible DeepLX baseURL configuration to work with different DeepLX providers. You can customize the baseURL to match your provider's specific endpoint format.

### Token Placeholder Support

You can use the `{{apiKey}}` placeholder in your baseURL to insert your API token at any position. This is useful when different DeepLX providers require tokens in different URL formats.

**Examples:**

1. **Token in path**: `https://api.deeplx.com/{{apiKey}}/translate`
2. **Token as query parameter**: `https://api.deeplx.com/v1/translate?token={{apiKey}}`
3. **Token in subdomain**: `https://{{apiKey}}.api.deeplx.com/translate`

### Special URL Handling

#### Standard DeepLX URLs

For most DeepLX providers, if your baseURL doesn't end with `/translate`, Read Frog will automatically append it:

- **Input**: `https://deeplx.example.com`
- **Output**: `https://deeplx.example.com/translate`

With API token:
- **Input**: `https://deeplx.example.com` + token `abc123`
- **Output**: `https://deeplx.example.com/abc123/translate`

#### api.deeplx.org Special Logic

For the official `https://api.deeplx.org` endpoint, Read Frog applies special logic to insert the API token between `.org` and `/translate`:

- **Without token**: `https://api.deeplx.org/translate`
- **With token**: `https://api.deeplx.org/your-token/translate`

### Configuration Examples

#### No API Token Required

Some DeepLX providers don't require authentication:

```
BaseURL: https://deeplx.vercel.app
API Key: (leave empty)
Result: https://deeplx.vercel.app/translate
```

#### Token in Path

```
BaseURL: https://api.deeplx.com/{{apiKey}}
API Key: your-secret-token
Result: https://api.deeplx.com/your-secret-token/translate
```

#### Token as Query Parameter

```
BaseURL: https://api.example.com/v1/translate?key={{apiKey}}
API Key: your-api-key
Result: https://api.example.com/v1/translate?key=your-api-key
```

#### Custom Endpoint with Token

```
BaseURL: https://deeplx.mydomain.com/api/{{apiKey}}/translate
API Key: abc123
Result: https://deeplx.mydomain.com/api/abc123/translate
```

## Setting Up DeepLX in Read Frog

1. **Open Extension Options**: Click the Read Frog extension icon and go to Options
2. **Navigate to API Providers**: Go to the API Providers section
3. **Configure DeepLX**:
   - Set your **BaseURL** according to your provider's format
   - Add your **API Key** if required (leave empty for providers that don't need it)
   - Use `{{apiKey}}` placeholder if you need custom token placement
4. **Test Translation**: Try translating some text to verify the configuration works

## Common DeepLX Providers

### Free Providers (No API Key)
- `https://deeplx.vercel.app`
- `https://deeplx.herokuapp.com`

### Paid/Self-hosted Providers
- `https://api.deeplx.org` (requires API key)
- Your own self-hosted instance

## Troubleshooting

### URL Construction Issues
If you're having issues with URL construction:

1. **Check your baseURL format**: Ensure it follows the expected pattern
2. **Verify token placement**: Make sure `{{apiKey}}` is in the correct position
3. **Test without token first**: Try with a free provider to isolate configuration issues

### Common Errors

- **"API key is required when using `{{apiKey}}` placeholder"**: You specified `{{apiKey}}` in the baseURL but didn't provide an API key
- **"DeepLX translation request failed"**: Check if your baseURL and API key are correct
- **Network errors**: Verify the DeepLX provider is accessible and online

## API Response Format

DeepLX providers should return JSON responses in this format:

```json
{
  "data": "translated text here"
}
```

If you're setting up your own DeepLX instance, ensure it returns responses in this expected format.
