## Welcome to Read Frog Blog! 🐸

We're excited to launch the Read Frog blog, a space where we'll share updates, guides, and insights about web translation and our browser extension.

### What is Read Frog?

Read Frog is a powerful browser extension that helps you translate web content seamlessly. Whether you're reading articles, browsing websites, or working with documents, Read Frog provides accurate translations powered by multiple AI providers.

### Why We Built This

We noticed that many translation tools either compromise on quality or on privacy. Some send all your data to external servers, while others provide subpar translations. Read Frog bridges this gap by:

1. **Supporting multiple providers** - You choose what works best for you
2. **Prioritizing privacy** - Your API keys stay local
3. **Open source** - Transparent and community-driven
4. **Modern UI** - Beautiful, intuitive interface
