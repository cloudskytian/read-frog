## Introducing Batch Translation 💰

Our first Beta feature tackles the biggest pain point for translation users: **API costs and rate limits**.

### The Problem We're Solving

Imagine reading a 20-paragraph article. With traditional translation:

- 📤 **20 separate API requests** sent to your LLM provider
- 💸 **5x the cost** - your credits drain fast
- 🚫 **Rate limit trap** - Hit "too many requests" errors constantly
- 😤 **Frustrating interruptions** - Reading flow broken

Sound familiar?

### The Solution: Smart Batching

<Callout type="tip">
**Batch Translation** groups multiple paragraphs into single API requests. Same quality, fraction of the cost.
</Callout>

Here's the magic:

| Before Batching | After Batching | Savings |
|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| 20 paragraphs = 20 API calls | 20 paragraphs = 3-4 API calls | **60-80% fewer calls** |
| $10/month API costs | $2-4/month API costs | **$6-8 saved monthly** |
| Hit rate limits frequently | Stay within limits easily | **No more interruptions** |

### Real-World Impact

**Cost Savings Example:**

If you translate 100 articles per month (averaging 20 paragraphs each):
- **Without batching**: 2,000 API calls
- **With batching**: 300-400 API calls
- **Savings**: 60-80% reduction = **API costs drop from $50 to $10-20/month**

<Callout type="warn">
**Free Tier Users**: Many providers limit you to 3-5 requests/minute. Batch translation lets you translate 5-10x more content within those limits!
</Callout>

## How to Enable 🎮

Getting started takes less than 60 seconds:

1. **Open Read Frog settings** (Click the extension icon → Settings)
2. **Navigate to Features** → **Beta Experience**
3. **Toggle "Enable Beta Experience"** to ON
4. **Find "Batch Translation"** section below
5. **Customize your batch settings** (or use smart defaults):

| Setting | Default | What It Does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Maximum Characters** | 1000 | How many characters to batch together |
| **Maximum Paragraphs** | 4 | How many paragraphs per batch |

**That's it!** Batch translation now works automatically when you translate web pages.

<Callout type="tip">
**Pro Tip**: Start with default settings (1000 chars, 4 paragraphs). They work great for most content. Adjust later based on your needs.
