## Batch Translation & Beta Experience - Save 60-80% on API Costs ðŸ’°

We're excited to announce two important updates: our new **Beta Experience** program for early feature access, and its first feature - **Batch Translation** that helps you save 60-80% on API costs. If you've ever hit rate limits or watched your API credits drain quickly when translating long articles, this update is for you!

## What is Beta Experience? ðŸš€

We're launching **Beta Experience** - a special program designed for power users who want to be at the forefront of Read Frog's innovation.

### Why Beta Experience Matters

- **First Access** - Try cutting-edge features before they reach general availability
- **Shape the Future** - Your feedback directly influences how features are developed and refined
- **Stay Ahead** - Access new capabilities as soon as they're ready, not months later
- **Risk-Free** - Easily toggle beta features on/off anytime - you're in complete control
- **Exclusive Preview** - Many fantastic features will launch in Beta first

If you're a power user who wants to experience the future of Read Frog **today**, Beta Experience is built for you. Our first beta feature is already delivering massive value - read on!

## Introducing Batch Translation ðŸ’°

Our first Beta feature is **Batch Translation** - a game-changing capability that saves you 60-80% on API costs and helps you avoid frustrating rate limit errors.

### How It Works

Instead of translating each paragraph separately, Read Frog now intelligently groups multiple paragraphs together and translates them in a single request to your AI provider.

**Before**: 20 paragraphs = 20 separate API requests
**After**: 20 paragraphs = 3-4 batched requests

That's a **60-80% reduction** in API calls!

### Real Benefits You'll Feel

- **Save 60-80% on API costs** - If you're spending $10/month on translations, this drops it to $2-4/month. Your API credits last 3-5x longer
- **Bypass rate limits** - Many free tier APIs limit you to 3-5 requests per minute. Batch translation lets you translate much more content within those limits without hitting "rate limit exceeded" errors
- **Uninterrupted reading** - No more stopping mid-article because you exhausted your quota
- **Smart batching** - Configurable limits let you balance between cost savings and translation granularity

If you've ever encountered "rate limit exceeded" errors while translating long articles, batch translation solves this by dramatically reducing the number of API calls.

### How to Enable Beta Experience & Batch Translation

1. Open Read Frog settings
2. Navigate to **Features** â†’ **Beta Experience**
3. Toggle **Enable Beta Experience** to ON
4. Scroll to the **Batch Translation** section
5. Customize your preferences:
   - **Maximum Characters**: How many characters to batch together (default: 1000)
   - **Maximum Paragraph Count**: How many paragraphs per batch (default: 4)

Once enabled, batch translation works automatically whenever you translate web pages!

### Use Cases

This feature shines when you're:

- **Using free tier APIs** - Many LLM providers have strict rate limits on free tiers; batch translation lets you translate more within those limits
- **Budget-conscious** - Save 60-80% on your monthly API expenses
- **Reading long articles** - Translate news articles, blog posts, and documentation without hitting rate limit errors
- **Researching** - Translate multiple research papers while staying within your API quota
- **Heavy users** - If you translate a lot daily, the cost savings add up quickly

### Fine-Tuning for Your Needs

The configurable limits let you balance between speed and quality:

- **Higher limits** (e.g., 2000 characters, 8 paragraphs) - Maximum speed, best for straightforward content
- **Lower limits** (e.g., 500 characters, 2 paragraphs) - More granular control, better for complex or technical content

Experiment to find what works best for your reading habits!

### What's Next?

This is just the beginning! We're continuously improving the batch translation feature based on your feedback. Future enhancements may include:

- Auto-optimization based on content type
- Provider-specific batching strategies
- Real-time performance metrics
