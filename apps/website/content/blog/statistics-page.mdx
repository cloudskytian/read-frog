## Track Your Savings - New Statistics Page 📊

Ever wonder **how much money** you're actually saving with batch translation? How many API calls you've avoided? Whether your usage is trending up or down?

We hear you. Numbers matter. **Seeing your savings** matters even more.

That's why we built the **Statistics Page** - your personal dashboard showing exactly how batch translation impacts your wallet and usage patterns.

## Why Statistics Matter 💡

You've enabled batch translation (smart move!). But without data, you're flying blind:

- 🤔 **"Am I really saving that much?"** - No way to know
- 📉 **"Is my usage increasing?"** - Just a guess
- 💰 **"How does this month compare?"** - Pure speculation

**The Statistics Page changes everything.**

<Callout type="info">
**Knowledge is Power**: Real data helps you optimize your settings, understand your patterns, and prove the ROI of batch translation.
</Callout>

## What You'll See 👀

### At a Glance Metrics

Four powerful metric cards greet you the moment you open Statistics:

| Metric | What It Shows | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Original Request Count** | How many API calls you *would have* made | Your baseline without batching |
| **Batch Request Count** | How many API calls you *actually* made | Your real API usage |
| **Requests Saved** | The difference (your efficiency gain) | Proof of savings |
| **Trend Indicators** | ↗️ Increase or ↘️ Decrease from previous period | Spot patterns instantly |

Each card shows **comparison with the previous period** - so you can see if things are getting better or worse at a glance.

<Callout type="tip">
**Green arrows are your friends**: ↗️ on "Requests Saved" means you're getting even more efficient!
</Callout>

## Visual Insights 📈

### The Savings Chart

Numbers are great. **Charts are better.**

Our interactive chart visualizes your batch translation activity over time:

- **📅 Flexible time periods**: View 5, 7, 30, or 60 days
- **🎨 Theme-aware**: Beautiful in both light and dark mode
- **📊 Two data series**:
  - **Original Requests** (what you would have paid)
  - **Batch Requests** (what you actually paid)

**The gap between the lines?** That's your savings.

### Real-World Example

Imagine you're a student translating research papers:

| Period | Original Requests | Batch Requests | Saved | Percentage |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-------|------------|
| Week 1 | 450 | 85 | 365 | **81%** |
| Week 2 | 520 | 98 | 422 | **81%** |
| Week 3 | 380 | 72 | 308 | **81%** |

**Consistent 81% savings** = You're using batch translation effectively!

<Callout type="warn">
**Spot Issues Early**: If your savings percentage suddenly drops, it might mean:
- Your batch settings need adjustment
- You're translating different content types
- Time to optimize your configuration
</Callout>

## Dive Deeper into Your Data 🔍

### Compare Time Periods

Toggle between different views to match your analysis needs:

| View | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **5 Days** | Spotting recent changes |
| **7 Days** | Weekly patterns (default) |
| **30 Days** | Monthly trends |
| **60 Days** | Long-term analysis |

### Understand Your Savings

The **savings percentage** prominently displayed tells you:

```
Savings % = (Original Requests - Batch Requests) / Original Requests
```

**Translation?** If you see **75%**, you're making 4 API calls instead of 16 for the same work.

<Callout type="info">
**Typical Savings Range**: Most users see 60-85% savings. If you're below 50%, consider increasing your batch size in settings.
</Callout>

## What the Numbers Mean 💭

Let's break down a real example:

---

**Your Statistics Show:**
- Original Request Count: **500**
- Batch Request Count: **100**
- Requests Saved: **400**
- Average Savings: **80%**

**What This Means:**

If your provider charges $0.01 per request:

| Scenario | Cost |
|----------|------|
| **Without Batching** | 500 × $0.01 = **$5.00** |
| **With Batching** | 100 × $0.01 = **$1.00** |
| **You Saved** | **$4.00** (80%) |

Scale this over a month of heavy usage? **Savings add up fast.**

<Callout type="tip">
**Pro Move**: Screenshot your statistics before and after adjusting batch settings to see what configuration gives you the best results.
